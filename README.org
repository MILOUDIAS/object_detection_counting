* Intro
This project is my final year project for my Master Thesis in electronics, so keep in mind that the project is just a prototype, so you have to fine-tune it to your needs

* The Project of my thesis
The Project is about object detection, tracking and counting with tensorflow lite for a raspberry pi,
and the data of detection, tracking and counting is shown on a webpage using the Flask library
* Deployment
To run the program just run the python script "object_detection_counting_web.py".
But don't forget to install the necessary packages from PIP or install them from the source !
