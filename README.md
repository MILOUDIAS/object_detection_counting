# Intro

This project implements an AI-based video surveillance system on a Raspberry Pi.
Utilizing advanced object detection and counting algorithms, the system is capable of real-time monitoring and analysis.
The core functionality leverages machine learning models to detect and count objects within the video feed,
making it suitable for various security and monitoring applications.

# Description

The Project is about object detection, tracking and counting with tensorflow lite for a raspberry pi,
and the data of detection, tracking and counting is shown on a webpage using the Flask library.
