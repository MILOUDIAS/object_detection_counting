* Intro
This project implements an AI-based video surveillance system on a Raspberry Pi.
Utilizing advanced object detection and counting algorithms, the system is capable of real-time monitoring and analysis.
The core functionality leverages machine learning models to detect and count objects within the video feed, 
making it suitable for various security and monitoring applications.

* Descroption
The Project is about object detection, tracking and counting with tensorflow lite for a raspberry pi,
and the data of detection, tracking and counting is shown on a webpage using the Flask library
* Deployment
To run the program just run the python script "object_detection_counting_web.py".
But don't forget to install the necessary packages from PIP or install them from the source !
